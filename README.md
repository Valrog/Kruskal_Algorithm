# Kruskal_Algorithm
An implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm in C++. 

This implementation makes use of a cluster to store vertices. This simplifies the examination of potential cycles. Since all sets are contained in one cluster, this method reduces the space complexity considerably. Time complexity should be comparably the same with regard to more classic approaches.
